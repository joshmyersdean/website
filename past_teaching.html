                <p>I developed and taught a short course on the scientific ideas powering digital photography to AP Physics students at Ithaca High School. I taught the course over three days to three different classes of about 20 students each. The sessions covered light transport, optics, digital sensors, and image processing. I developed an interactive lab activity for each session to give students hands-on experience. Course materials are available upon request.

                <p>I shared responsibilities for all aspects of this large course with my co-instructor, <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/gries/">David Gries</a>. In an effort to incorporate active learning techniques in a large lecture environment, I introduced the use of in-class polling using Piazza, which had previously been only used for online Q&amp;A in this course. We found that this is particularly helpful in helping students recognize concepts they need to study in more depth. My other responsibilities included:
                <ul>
                    <li>Giving lectures for 2110 (about 620 students) and the associated 1-credit supplement course, 2111 (about 100 students).</li>
                    <li>Updating, releasing, and overseeing the grading of eight programming assignments.</li>
                    <li>Developing new tutorial videos on Java language constructs and data structures.</li>
                    <li>Managing a staff of 42 undergraduate and graduate consultants and TAs.</li>
                    <li>Developing, giving, and overseeing the grading of exams.</li>
                </ul>
                This was a fantastic experience and I look forward to doing more teaching in the future!

            <p>Working with <a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~snavely">Noah Snavely</a> and a great team of TAs, I helped run the research project portion of the 2015 edition of Cornell Diversity Programs in Engineering's <a href="http://www.engineering.cornell.edu/diversity/summer/high_school/curie/index.cfm">CURIE Academy</a>. 52 high school girls from all over the country (and a few from Europe!) spent a week at Cornell learning what engineering is all about. They spent each morning being introduced to a couple different fields of engineering, then spent each afternoon with us, learning how to do image processing in Matlab and working in teams to implement some really cool projects. I taught lessons during the first two days and supervised two group projects for the final two days. One group implemented custom <a href="img/curie_filters.jpg">photoshop-like filters</a> and the other did <a href="img/curie_webcam.jpg">live webcam face tracking</a>.</p>

            office hours, and managed project grading. In Fall 2013, I held
            office hours, provided extra help sessions for a hearing-impaired
            student, and graded projects.</p>
